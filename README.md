I'm developing an E-commerce application using the RESTful API architecture, with the frontend built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm using Java along with the Spring Boot framework to implement CRUD operations and business rule validations. The technologies included are: automated documentation using Spring Doc-OpenAPI, database migration with Flyway, and credit card validation. This project is ongoing for the Software Engineering Laboratory course.
